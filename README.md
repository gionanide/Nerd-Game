# Nerd-Game
Nerd Game is an app game which tests you in very nerd questions of computer science, maths etc. 
You have three lives and you can modify your game, if you want to play against the clock. 
All the questions are in a SQLserver which is connected to the GUI part. In the beggining you can sign up and make your own account,
and start trying test yourself.
